PID CONTROL FOR 1-DOF MASS SPRING DAMPER (RECTI-LINEAR)
The   report   is   to   be   based   on   the   Dynamics   of   a   single   degree   of   freedom   vibrations encountered in the ECP Rectilinear experiment. The report should not   exceed   a word   count   of 2000 words in total (excluding references) and student   should attempt   to   answer these   questions. 
NB: as per DMU report writing guidelines, please include a cover page including your name, p-number, module name, module code, report title and tutor name. 
1.       Provide brief   introduction of   the system and explain the aims   and the   objectives   of   the experiment.        [5 m代 写ENGE2002 Dynamics, Instrumentation and ControlMatlab

2.       Identify parameters of   the   1DoF systems using approach described in   Section   3   of   the   lab instruction.            [7.5 marks]
3.       Plot transient responses for different values of   the proportional gain Kp (in   one   co-         ordinate system) using the MATLAB ‘plot’ command for the proportional controller   investigated in   Sections 2.                                                   [5 marks]
4.       Evaluate the parameters of   the transient responses (tpeak, tr, ts, ess)   and   describe how   they are affected by the gain Kp.            [5   marks]
5.       Plot transient responses in one co-ordinate system   for changing Ki values   and   another   co-ordinate system for changing Kd values using the MATLAB ‘plot’   command   for         the PID controller investigated in   Section 2.3.                                       [5   marks]
6.       Evaluate the parameters of   the transient response (tpeak, tr , ts, ess) and   describe   how   they are affected by gains Ki and Kd.       [7.5 marks]
7.       For each controller configuration in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, derive the closed-loop system   transfer function and investigate how the location of   poles changes with the changes of gains Kp, Ki, and Kd using MATLAB.                            [10 marks]
8.       Provide brief   conclusions and recommendations for the experiment.    [5 marks]
